Twitter
-------

Twitter is probably the easiest way to get in touch with us. Make sure to `follow
us on Twitter`_. We also search Twitter from time to time and see if we can engage
with the people who are using VerneMQ but also those of you who are just curious
about VerneMQ.

.. _follow us on Twitter: http://twitter.com/vernemq


Mailing List
------------

We host a low traffic `mailing list`_ where we you can ask and answer questions
about VerneMQ installation, operations, but also plugin development.

.. _mailing list: http://verne.mq/mailman/listinfo/vernemq-list_verne.mq


IRC Channel
-----------

The VerneMQ channel on `Freenode`_ is also a good alternative to Twitter if you want
to get in touch with the devs of VerneMQ.

.. _Freenode: https://freenode.net


Github
------

If you run into any issues with VerneMQ we ask you to `report this issue`_ so we can
fix it in one of the next releases. Github also allows you to easily contribute 
a bugfix or a feature, which we are more than happy to discuss, review, and in the
best case merge into the VerneMQ codebase.
