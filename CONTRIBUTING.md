# How to contribute to the VerneMQ Project and the VerneMQ Mission

We welcome any kind of contribution: documentation, fixing bugs, adding features, writing tests, opening issues, having discussions and fun...


Here are some possible next steps for you:

  * Open an Issue [Github Issues](https://github.com/vernemq/vernemq/issues)
  * Join our new Mailing list [VerneMQ user list](http://groups.google.com/group/vernemq-users/)
  * Join the new VerneMQ Community Team, by sending us your Github name, so that we can invite you. The Github Discussion board will be used  for feature and roapmap discussions.

If your issue is related to one of the subprojects of VerneMQ, like docker-vernemq, or vernemq_dev, please open an issue there rather than in the main VerneMQ repository.
 

## Testing

If you propose a feature in a Pull Request, make sure to add tests for your feature. It is also good practice to talk to us about the feature itself before you start implementing.
